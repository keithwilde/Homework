problems with usb 6009, limited 

 leds
ttl
low voltage
low i
dc

optical isolator
4n25
higher v 12 volts dc , input side led (had to limit it to 60 mA max) , output transistor (limited to 30 V 50 mA)
higher i
advantage 7500 v protection




Solid State Relays

dc -----------


1n914
d1 reverses voltage if hooked up in reverse to protect
optical isolation in u1
q3 npn transistor 4 amp transistor, d3 protects transistor against reverse polarity, only run ac

forward bias


ac ------------------
triac
when one is forward bias the other is reverse - allows you to pass ac, only run ac
if you put ac it never turns off, expects cycle
-----------------------------------
ssrs disadvantages
will overheat


lightbulb recepticle 
2 amps
max wattage lightbulb 60 which takes 1/2 amp

terminal
load
in series
forward/reverse bias
